## Types of targets

1. Precipitation weather targets: rain, drizzle, snow, hail, etc.
2. Non precipitating weather targets: ice clouds, water clouds, and refractive index gradients causing clear-air echoes.
3. Non-meteorological targets: ash, insects, birds,airplanes, ground and sea surfaces.

## Precipitation process: a quick overview

Dynamical processes determine the structure and spatial extent of the areas of vertical motion required to generate clouds and precipitation, while microphysical processes control the water vapour supersaturation, resulting from upward motion, is ultimately transferred into precipitation.

Two important instabilities that may cause enough vertical motion to generate precipitation: baroclinic instability and the convective instability.

**baroclinic instability**: arises from the meridional temperature gradient in an atmosphere in quasi-geostrophic equilibrium and possessing static stability. It leads to large scale midlatitude cyclones. Precipitation is light and covers broad areas.

**convective instability**: occurs when a lighter fluids such as warm air overcomes the influence of viscous forces and rises ove a heavier fluid such as colder air. Convective instability gives rise to showers and thundershowers, and individual cells have a horizontal scale of the order of 10km. Convective rain has high intensity and complex 3-D structure.

Echoes are different depending on the dynamical process dominating precipitation formation.
